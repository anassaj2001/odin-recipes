    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Making traditional Italian pasta by hand is a beautiful
        and satisfying process that begins with just a few simple ingredients:
        flour, eggs, and a pinch of salt. The dough is kneaded until smooth and elastic,
        then left to rest before being rolled out into delicate sheets. From there, it's cut into ribbons,
        folded into tortellini, or shaped into rustic orecchiette — 
        all by hand, just like generations of Italian nonnas have done. 
        The fresh pasta cooks quickly and has a tender bite that dried pasta just can't match.

        To elevate the flavor, grated Parmigiano-Reggiano is mixed directly into the dough or generously
        sprinkled over the hot pasta right before serving. The cheese melts slightly into the warm noodles, 
        adding a salty, nutty richness that pairs perfectly with a simple butter sauce or a fresh tomato basil reduction. 
        It's not just a meal — it's a celebration of Italy’s culinary heritage on a plate.
